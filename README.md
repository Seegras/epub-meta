# epub-meta
dump epub metadata

Peter Keel <seegras@discordia.ch>, March 2012

This program dumps the metadata of an epub-file. It's 
based on libepub by Ely Levy <elylevy@cs.huji.ac.il>

This version comes without epub-rename; see either the homepage
at http://seegras.discordia.ch/Programs/ or the git repo 
https://github.com/Seegras/metatags
